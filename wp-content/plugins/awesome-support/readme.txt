**What does it do?**

Check out the user-friendly features of this awesome plugin:

- **Ticketing**: users can submit tickets from the front-end, and your agents respond to them from the WordPress back-end
- **E-mail notifications**: relevant parties are notified of certain actions by e-mail, and all e-mails are customizable. Choose from a selection of six email notifications (new ticket, reply to agent, reply to client etc.)
- **Restricted access**: all correspondence is private between the client and the agents (unless the PUBLIC TICKETS premium add-on is installed and configured)
- **File upload**: you control when files can be uploaded, how many files, and how large they are
- **Multiple products**: provide support for as many products as you want; synchronize product lists with popular e-commerce platforms such as WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads (EDD)
- **Multiple departments**: provide support for multiple departments
- **Custom fields**: easily set up additional custom fields on your ticket forms (and our premium Custom Fields add-on offers even more convenience).  Choose from 13 field types, control where they show up (front-end, back-end, ticket list, ticket form etc.) and decide who can view them.
- **Terms & conditions**: ask users to agree to your your terms and conditions before they open a ticket
- **Old tickets**: identify old tickets quickly with tags; limit your viewable ticket list to only show old tickets with just a couple of clicks
- **Tickets waiting on you**: Quickly see all tickets still waiting for a reply - two clicks is all it takes to limit your ticket list to only those tickets!
- **Agent Collaboration**: multiple agents can work on the same ticket and tickets can be transferred between agents; assign primary, secondary and tertiary agents to tickets while retaining the flexibility to transfer a ticket to any other agent.
- **Sorting And Filtering**: includes an amazing flexible sorting, filtering and tagging system for your tickets
- **Security**: assign just the right capabilities to each of your agents including just the ability to see their own tickets or expand to see everyone's tickets - your choice!
- **Tracking**: easily track where a ticket originated (support form, email, facebook, phone call etc.)
- **Prioritize your way**: create your own priority scheme - you don't have to get locked into a 1-5 priority scheme!
- **Time Tracking**: basic time tracking is included!  Admins can even adjust time and all time changes are logged directly in the ticket. 
- **Custom status**: sign up for our email newsletter and get our Custom Status plugin for free - unlimited color coded, customized statuses and ticket labels at your fingertips! Combined with priorities and tags you have the ultimate system for categorizing and tracking your tickets!
- **WordPress UI**: Uses the familiar WordPress administration user interface so there is almost no learning curve!  And, because we respect the WordPress UI standards you can use any 3rd party styling tool to create the look you want (see the screenshots section for examples)

== Installation ==

= Using The WordPress Dashboard =

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
2. Search for 'Awesome Support'
3. Click 'Install Now'
4. Activate the plugin on the Plugin dashboard

= Uploading in WordPress Dashboard =

1. Download `awesome-support.zip` from this page
2. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
3. Navigate to the 'Upload' area
4. Select `awesome-support.zip` from your computer
5. Click 'Install Now'
6. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

= Using FTP =

1. Download `awesome-support.zip` from this page
2. Extract the `awesome-support` directory to your computer
3. Upload the `awesome-support` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

= Setup =

Whatever the method you used, after you activated the plugin through the plugins dashboard, the setup is done silently in the background.

Two new pages will be added to your site:

- My Tickets
- Submit ticket

Add those two pages to your menu in order to give your users easy access to their support area.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Missing tabs or menu options after version 4.0 upgrade =

This happens because new WordPress custom security capabilities were introduced in version 4.0.0 of Awesome Support.  [Read this FAQ on our site to learn how adjust your system for these new security items.] (https://getawesomesupport.com/question/missing-tabs-menu-options-version-4-0-upgrade/)

= I get a blank page after ticket submission =

This is most likely a permalinks issue. What you need to do is log into your WordPress admin, go to *Settings > Permalinks* and hit the *Save* button. You don't actually need to change anything, just hitting *Save* will refresh your permalinks structure, including the new `ticket` post type.

= The plugin data isn't removed from the database after uninstall =

If you want to delete the plugin and all of its data, you need to go to the *Advanced* tab in the plugin settings and check the *Delete Data* option. Only then the data will be removed from the database during the uninstall process.

= Users get "You do not have the capacity to open a new ticket" =

Normally, when a user registers through the plugin, he/she is given the role *Support User*. [This role has special capabilities](http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities).

If your users get the error message *"You do not have the capacity to open a new ticket"*, it means that they don't have the special capabilities.

Here you have two choices:

1. Change all your users' role to *Support User*
2. Give the role you want to use (eg. *Subscriber*) the special capabilities

If you don't know how to add new capabilities to a role, we suggest you use a plugin like [User Role Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/) and give the desired role the following capabilities:

- `view_ticket`
- `create_ticket`
- `close_ticket`
- `reply_ticket`
- `attach_files`

**Do not give your users more than those 5 capabilities**, otherwise they could get administrative privileges.

= How to disable agent auto-assignment =

If you need to disable the auto-assignment function and hence have all new tickets assigned to the default agent (set in the plugin general settings), you can add this constant in your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
define( 'WPAS_DISABLE_AUTO_ASSIGN', true );
`

= How to set the product field as mandatory? =

If you have enabled multi-products support and want to make the "Product" field in the submission form mandatory, just add the following code snippet to your theme's `functions.php` file: https://gist.github.com/julien731/a519956ce9c81542439c

= How to change the tickets slug? =

By default, all tickets will be accessed through a URL of the type domain.com/ticket/my-ticket-title.

If you wish to change the slug `ticket` to something else, let's say `help`, so that your URLs look like domain.com/help/my-ticket-title, you need to add a constant in your theme's `functions.php` file as follows:

`
define( 'WPAS_SLUG', 'my_new_slug' );
`

= I don't receive e-mail notifications =

There are several factors that can influence e-mail notifications delivery. Please read this article for details: https://getawesomesupport.com/email-notifications-awesome-support-wordpress/

== Screenshots ==

1. Agent's view of the tickets list (2016 theme)
2. Client view of the tickets list (2016 theme)
3. Client view - ticket details (2016 theme)

6. Login/Registration screen with guest tickets add-on enabled (2016 theme)
7. Agent's view when replying to a ticket. Notice the red stripe in the opening post - that header is color coded based on the ticket priority and lets the agent know at a glance that they are working on a high-priority ticket.
8. A highly minimized view so you can see more areas of a ticket that is available to an agent.  Notice the time tracking area at the bottom and the increased number of metaboxes on the right that provide a ton of additional data and functions.
9. A very stylized version of the agents ticket list (done with CSS or a 3rd party styling plugin - your styling possibilities are endless!)
10. A very stylized version of a ticket - agent view (done with CSS or a 3rd party styling plugin - imagine the possibilities for creating your own styles that match your brand!)

	* Filter added to reply form - wpas_show_reply_form_front_end - can be used to control whether the reply form should be shown on the front-end.
	* Option to remove rating request in wp-admin footer.
	* Add new filter wpas_allow_loading - allow loading / not loading of AS - useful to avoid loading AS when traffic received is from a bot. 
	* Add new filter wpas_allow_soft_loading - allow loading / not loading of AS - useful to avoid loading AS when traffic received is from a bot. This one is different from the one above in that it uses a RETURN statement instead of a DIE statement when the filter evaluates to FALSE.
	* Add new internal function wpas_filter_input_server() that helps to work around a known PHP bug involving INPUT_SERVER and the FILTER_INPUT() function.

* Fix
	* class-logger __destruct was assuming a file name instead of a resource handle when attempting to close a file.
	* A function in class-logger were attempting to close a file using the filename instead of the file resource handle.
	* Log files need to be in separate folders when running under multi-site.
	* Fix: Core taxonomy custom fields were not using the slugs defined in wp-config.  This affected the PRODUCTS, DEPT, PRIORITY and CHANNEL fields that are shipped as part of core.  It also affected any user defined custom fields as it forced the rewrite slug to be the same as the name.

= 4.3.2 =

* Fix
	* Fix minor grammar issue on general settings tab.
	
* Notes
	* 4.2.0 was never submitted to the wordpress repo. So the upgrade is from 4.1.0 to 4.2.1, not 4.2.0 but includes all the 4.2.0 improvements and fixes outlined below.

= 4.2.0 =

* New
	* Added option to change the batch size used when cleaning up expired sessions
	* New: Filter added to INIT function in wpas-session class. You can use the new wpas_initiate_session_flag filter to disable creating the session. This would be useful when the traffic is coming from bot sources such as pingdom or uptimerobot.
	* New: Filter added to the wpas_can_reply_ticket function.  The new filter, wpas_can_also_reply_ticket, allows overriding the checks that determines if a user can reply to a ticket.
	
* Improvements
	* When filtering by ticket id, remove all other filters.
	* Added options to control which tabs are shown at the top of the TICKET LIST screen.

	* Added two new internal fields on the ticket cpt to store the last reply date and whether the ticket is waiting for a reply or not.

* Improvements

	* Tweak: Updated titan framework library EDD plugin Updater to 1.6.4 which fixes a few items including reducing the number of license calls to the add-ons licensing server
	* (***Breaking Change***)  Tweak: Custom field attribute show_column is now only used to control whether the column shows up on the back-end ticket list.  Use the new show_frontend_list and show_frontend_detail attributes to control where and how a column shows up on the front end.
	* Tweak: Compatibility layer for certain themes that load different versions of the select2 file.  We now include the full select2 distribution as an option that can be set in TICKETS->SETTINGS->ADVANCED

* Improvements	
	* Tweak: Only update CHANNEL in wpas_insert_ticket if channel field is blank.  This allows some other filter/action hooks to override the default channel.
	* Tweak: Modified notifications class so it can be extended.
	
= 4.0.5 =

	* Show full date/time for replies when user hovers.
	* Show time elasped since ticket was open on replies when user hovers.
	* Changed upgrade routine name to make sure it runs when upgrading from 3.x.
	* Simplified logic related to when the AWAITING REPLY tag is shown.  Before it was shown to agents who were not involved on a ticket even if another agent had already replied to the ticket.
	* Always show the agent column in the admin ticket list.  Before, we would remove that column if an agent who was not an admin was viewing the list.

* Bugfixes

= 4.0.4 =

* Bugfixes
	* For full product resync under the TOOLS menu option do not delete the existing products in the AS product taxonomy if they are used in tickets already
	* Verify that a folder is writable before writing a .htaccess file to it.
	* Check for empty value after calling a function in the stakeholders.php metabox code.  Prevents debug.log error from being thrown while still allowing for the proper agent dropdown to be shown on the screen.
	* Issue with activation on multisite single-blog mode - activation was not completing properly.
	* Issue with licensing infrastructure for add-ons. Not all licenses would allow for activation after the licensing server software was updated
	

= 4.0.3 =

* Bugfixes

= 4.0.2 =

* Bugfixes
	* Incorrect error message shown when PHP version is not adequate.
	* Compatibility shim for sensei plugin - it pukes post ids indiscrimnately on all custom post type pages so we have to disable it on our pages.
	* Ticket slug settings were not being respected when the ticket was opened in wp-admin.
	* Applied an explicity INT cast to the time tracking fields when retriving data (just in case they somehow end up with non-numeric data)
	* Admin ticket list lost the email address for the ticket creator.

= 4.0.1 =

= 4.0.0 =
* New	
	* Minimum required version of PHP is now 5.6
	* Minimum required version of WP is the 4.x line.
	* Major revamp of sorting and filtering capabilities
		* More taxonomy fields now work when filtering and sorting
		* Can enter a ticket number to find a ticket quickly
		* All other fields can sort or filter
			* Exception: Product - can only sort on Product not filter (filter will be added in a future version)
			* Exception: Agent - can only filter on agent; cannot sort by it.
	* Added a set of fields that will be used for time tracking.
		* Basic time tracking so agent can set time spent on ticket.
		* Notes fields
		* Options to show/not show the fields on the ticket
		* Options to show/not show the fields in the ticket list on the back end
		* Options to show the fields disabled on the ticket (used when another plugin is updating the fields)
	* Added two "Additional Agent" fields.  These agents can be notified of ticket events and can see the tickets in their ticket list.
		* Limitation: There are no email template tags for additional agents to all emails CCed to the additional agents will still reference the primary agent.
	* You can now set the number of tickets per page that is shown on the front end.  The default is still 5.  (Some customers had hundreds of tickets for clients based on how they were using the plugin).
	* Custom fields:
		* Now have an option to be "backend" only.  (Documentation to be updated after release).
		* Can now be set as "readonly". (Documentation to be updated after release).
		* Now have options to control capabilities specific to custom taxonomy fields.
	* There is now a new explicit field for ticket PRIORITY.  You can configure your own priorities and color code them.  This field is optional and can be turned on for the front-end, back-end or both and can be made mandatory or optional.
		* If a priority is set and a color is chosen for the priority then the ticket header will change to reflect that color.
	* There is a new optional CHANNEL field that allows you to select where a help request originated. The drop-down is pre-configured with a number of common channels such as FACEBOOK and EMAIL.  In many instances it will be up to the agent to fill in the field - it is not automatically populated in most cases. But it is automatically populated and set for tickets generated from the standard ticket form, gravity forms and those opened via email.
	* Added internal fields to store a count of the number of replies on a ticket.  This is going to be useful on reports.
		* Use the button under the TOOLS->SETTINGS->CLEANUP tab to update the fields on older tickets.
	* Added a set of fields to store "additional interested parties".  These are simply notational fields that do nothing right now but they set the stage for future alerts and notices.
	* Save the date the ticket was closed in new metafields.  Before, the date the ticket was closed was not explicitly saved which made it very hard to use the closing date on reports.
	* New WordPress Capabilities have been added:
		* view_all_tickets.  This allows non-admin agents to view and update all tickets in the ticket list if the capability is assigned.
		* view_unassigned_tickets: This allows non-admin agents to view and update unassigned tickets if the capability is assigned.
		* manage_licenses_for_awesome_support:  This allows the license box to be hidden.  It is now only shown to admin users by default.
		* administer_awesome_support: Will be used in future versions and add-ons to limit certain things to Awesome Support admins instead of forcing users to log in with full WP Admin capabilities
		* Other capabilities specifc to the new pre-installed custom taxonomies.
	* Add new options for specifying the ticket slug (post id, random number, guid are now options.  See TICKETS->Settings->Advanced)
	* When replying to a ticket you can choose whether to automatically go to the next ticket in the list or the previous ticket in the list (in addition to the prior options of staying in the ticket and going back to the ticket list).
	* Add ticket id to front end ticket list.
	* Labels for built-in custom fields can now be retrieved from the OPTIONS array if they exist otherwise default to built-in text values
	* Add action hooks:
		* execute_additional_tools to allow add-ons to add their own buttons to the TOOLS->CLEANUP tab.
		* wpas_show_done_tool_message allow add-ons to show a message after running a tool.
		* wpas_backend_ticket_stakeholders_before to allow add-ons to access the the stakeholders metabox
		* wpas_insert_reply_admin_failed to hook into failed replies from the back-end (rare event, should never be needed but added just in case)
		* wpas_ticket_after_update_admin_success to hook into updates done from the admin screen
		* wpas_insert_reply_admin_success to hook into replies done from the admin screen
		* wpas_post_new_ticket_admin to hook into new tickets done from the admin screen
	* Add filter hooks:

		* wpas_fe_template_detail_author_avatar allows for the opportunity to change the avatar in the details template on the front end
		* wpas_fe_template_detail_author_display_name allows for the opportunity to change the display name in the details template on the front end
	* wpas_dropdown now supports a "multiple" attribute
	* Politely requests user to rate after 25 closed tickets.
	
* Improvements
	* Action hook wpas_insert_ticket is now passing an additional parameter containing the original data received before any changes.
	* Cleaned up Custom Post Type definitions for ticket replies, logs and history so that third party tools can more easily identify them. Prior to this change they all appeared with the name "POSTS" to third party tools which wasn't very useful.
	* Checkbox custom field can now be shown on the TICKET LIST screen on the back end.
	* Some Internal updates to support the add-on infrastructure for certain add-ons.
		* Functions in functions-email-notifications.php uses a new hook wpas_add_reply_complete so that email notifications now occur AFTER attachments have been processed
		* A similar hook was added/modified in functions-post.php for the same reason
		* Added a couple of functions to get tickets belonging to a particular agent
		* Added hooks in the ticket details metabox to be able to add content before and after the default ticket content
		* Added processing code for using an ATTACHMENTS tag in email templates
		* Adjusted the location where custom fields data is updated in the ticket.  This is an internal change to ensure that certain alerts have access to the information stored in custom fields.
		* Updated to allow custom fields to show in the user profile (under very limited and narrow circumstances this is ok but not intended for use by outside developers)
	* Settings screen changes
		* New tab for Basic Time Tracking fields
		* New tab for Products configuration
	Uninstall Routine Updates:
		* Delete ticket attachment folders on the local drives
		* Uninstall the new taxonomy fields introduced in this version

* Bugfixes
	* Cleaned up a few PHP notices
	* Allow translation of PRODUCT and DEPARTMENT header on ticket list (backend)
	* The USER PROFILE metabox/widget on the ticket detail page now shows the full count of open/closed tickets with or without filters applied.  It will now always show the real count regardless of the number of tickets listed underneat the summary.
	* Show more than 10 add-ons in the ADD-ONs screen
	* Better sychronization between Custom Status and the TICKETS->SETTINGS->STYLE tab.
		* To make sync work properly you need to first manually make sure that your color settings in the Tickets->Settings->Style tab matches the ones in Custom Status. Once that is done syncing between core the the add-on will work properly.
		* When the agent selected "Back to List" for their "after reply" action in their personal profile, this action did not work.  Fixed.
	* Removed the word "PUBLIC" from certain template tags that aren't really public options
	* Only activate plugin on single site activation.  Network activation on multi-site should do nothing now since there is no specific multisite functionality available.
	* Removed use of legacy method to check of custom field exists.
	* Custom fields could not handle multiple checkbox values being stored.
	* Updated default styles on checkbox and radio button custom fields.
	* Remove some unused code.

* Upgrade Instructions
	* After installing the new version please go to your TICKETS->SETTINGS tabs and click the SAVE CHANGES button to write the defaults for new options to your database.
	* If it seems that certain options are missing from your TICKETS menu or your TICKETS->SETTINGS screen then please go to TICKETS->TOOLS->CLEANUP and click the button to re-run the 3.3.4 to 4.0.0 upgrade.  This will add in any missing WordPress security capabilities to your installation.
	
* Deprecated or Removed	
	* PHP 5.2 and PHP 5.3 no longer supported.  Portions of the plugin were not supported by 5.2 for a while now but going forward no testing will be done on PHP 5.2.   The minimum supported PHP version is 5.6.3.
	* Support for the version 3.x line of WP is being deprecated  - going forward there will be no more testing or support on these versions.

== Upgrade Notice ==
The version 4.x.x line is a MAJOR upgrade from 3.x.x.  It is strongly suggested that you test this upgrade in a stage/test environment before applying it to your production site.  
At the very least you should back-up your site before applying this update!

After upgrading please make sure you install the latest version of add-ons as well - especially the Email Support add-on (Version 5.0.x) and Gravity Forms.

Automatic upgrades to 4.0.0 are only supported from version 3.3.4. If you are running an earlier version in the 3.x line please make sure you upgrade to 3.3.4 FIRST, verify that all your settings are intact and then install version 4.
Upgrades from the version 2.x and 1.x lines are NOT supported at all.

After upgrading you might notice that menu options under TICKETS are missing or the tabs inside your TICKETS->SETTINGS screen are missing.  If so, please try any or all of the following:

	1. Go to TICKETS->TOOLS->CLEANUP and find the upgrade button and click that to re-run the upgrade.  This will add required WordPress security capabilities back to the system.
	2. Go to your TICKETS->SETTINGS screen and click the SAVE button.  This adds the default settings that are new for version 4.0 to your installation.
	3. Deactivate the add-on and re-activate it.  This triggers some housekeeping tasks.
