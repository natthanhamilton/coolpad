The most versatile help desk and support plugin for WordPress. Provide awesome support directly from your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Awesome Support is the most versatile support plugin for WordPress. It’s the result of two years of work, research, and improvement. The features are an answer to user requests for a solid, WordPress-based help desk, and that's what makes it the best!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdSOWQI3tWU

For support please visit the [official site](http://getawesomesupport.com).

= Seamless Integration =

Awesome Support was built to be compatible with 99% of all existing themes, both free and commercial. It’s "plug & play" - all settings and templates are automatically switched on as soon as you click the "Activate" button, so you can get started with providing support straight away.

= Responsive Design =

Awesome Support provides an optimized viewing experience for easy reading and navigation with minimal resizing, panning, and scrolling. Do your clients regularly submit tickets on the go? Awesome Support is responsive, so they’ll enjoy a seamless experience from the convenience of their mobile phone (provided the theme you use is also responsive).

= Robust Code =

Version 3 of Awesome Support was built with flexibility in mind; the code is clean, well-documented and full of hooks. Customize Awesome Support to do almost anything you want or need.

Awesome Support relies on the [Titan Framework](http://www.titanframework.net/) to handle plugin options. This framework is built by expert WordPress developers and well-maintained on GitHub.

= What does it do? =

Check out the user-friendly features of this awesome plugin:

- **Ticketing**: users can submit tickets from the front-end, and your agents can help them from the WordPress back-end
- **E-mail notifications**: relevant people are notified of certain actions by e-mail, and all e-mails are customizable
- **Restricted access**: all correspondence is private between the client and the agents
- **File upload**: you control when files can be uploaded, how many files, and how large they are
- **Multiple products**: provide support for as many products as you want
- **Custom fields**: easily set up additional custom fields
- **Terms & conditions**: ask users to agree to your your terms and conditions before they open a ticket
- **Old tickets**: identify old tickets quickly with tags

= Extensions =

Awesome Support is already packed with features, but if you want to supercharge your support and make it even MORE awesome, our free and premium add-ons allow you to extend the plugin's functionality even further! All of our add-ons are extremely affordable (they’re a fraction of the cost of a web-based application).

== Installation ==

= Using The WordPress Dashboard =

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
2. Search for 'Awesome Support'
3. Click 'Install Now'
4. Activate the plugin on the Plugin dashboard

= Uploading in WordPress Dashboard =

1. Download `awesome-support.zip` from this page
2. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
3. Navigate to the 'Upload' area
4. Select `awesome-support.zip` from your computer
5. Click 'Install Now'
6. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

= Using FTP =

1. Download `awesome-support.zip` from this page
2. Extract the `awesome-support` directory to your computer
3. Upload the `awesome-support` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

= Setup =

Whatever the method you used, after you activated the plugin through the plugins dashboard, the setup is done silently in the background.

Two new pages will be added to your site:

- My Tickets
- Submit ticket

Add those two pages to your menu in order to give your users easy access to their support area.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get a blank page after ticket submission =

This is most likely a permalinks issue. What you need to do is log into your WordPress admin, go to *Settings > Permalinks* and hit the *Save* button. You don't actually need to change anything, just hitting *Save* will refresh your permalinks structure, including the new `ticket` post type.

= The plugin data isn't removed from the database after uninstall =

If you want to delete the plugin and all of its data, you need to go to the *Advanced* tab in the plugin settings and check the *Delete Data* option. Only then the data will be removed from the database during the uninstall process.

= Users get "You do not have the capacity to open a new ticket" =

Normally, when a user registers through the plugin, he is given the role *Support User*. [This role has special capabilities](http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities).

If your users get the error message *"You do not have the capacity to open a new ticket"*, it means that they don't have the special capabilities.

Here you have two choices:

1. Change all your users' role to *Support User*
2. Give the role you want to use (eg. *Subscriber*) the special capabilities

If you don't know how to add new capabilities to a role, I suggest you use a plugin like [User Role Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/) and give the desired role the following capabilities:

- `view_ticket`
- `create_ticket`
- `close_ticket`
- `reply_ticket`
- `attach_files`

**Do not give your users more than those 5 capabilities**, otherwise they could get administrative privileges.

= How to disable agent auto-assignment =

If you need to disable the auto-assignment function and hence have all new tickets assigned to the default agent (set in the plugin general settings), you can add this constant in your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
define( 'WPAS_DISABLE_AUTO_ASSIGN', true );
`

= How to set the product field as mandatory? =

If you have enabled multi-products support and want to make the "Product" field in the submission form mandatory, just add the following code snippet to your theme's `functions.php` file: https://gist.github.com/julien731/a519956ce9c81542439c

= How to change the tickets slug? =

By default, all tickets will be accessed through a URL of the type domain.com/ticket/my-ticket-title.

If you wish to change the slug `ticket` to something else, let's say `help`, so that your URLs look like domain.com/help/my-ticket-title, you need to add a constant in your theme's `functions.php` file as follows:

`
define( 'WPAS_SLUG', 'my_new_slug' );
`

= I don't receive e-mail notifications =

There are several factors that can influence e-mail notifications delivery. Please read this article for details: https://getawesomesupport.com/email-notifications-awesome-support-wordpress/

1. Agent's view (tickets list)
2. Agent's view (ticket details)
3. Agent creates a ticket
4. Client view (tickets list)
5. Client view (ticket details)
6. Client creates a ticket
